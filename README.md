# PDF-to-Text-to-Speech Python Automation
This Python script allows you to convert the text content of a PDF file into speech and save it as an MP3 audio file. The automation app extracts text from each page of the PDF and uses the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to convert it into speech. The resulting audio is then saved as an MP3 file.
# Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* pypdf
* gTTS
